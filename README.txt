Here you will find how you can run the code and what you need to run it. 

first step is to go the directory using the command below in shell:

cd [diroctroy] cd file name which is (( you can see an images in images folder of how to do it)

Then,

run the command MAKE: 
You will see an image for this command in the Image folder in the zip file. 

After that write the command (( ./test.sh))) it is also showing in a picture, please find it. 

I also Included an image to show that the program tested all the cases with no fault including the 7 cases I wrote.  

1) MAKE is used   to compile the python script 

.2) /test.sh ' is used  to test cases in the shell scripts! 

Note :

‫***‬ I have add 7 more cases. The program is working very well and test  all cases including mine. 

‫***‬ as references I have used: 
Stackoverflow

https://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Doc/Makefile
and some youtube lessons to help me learn more about how to run and understand the task.
